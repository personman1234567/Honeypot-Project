# Honeypot-Project

### Overview:

Driven by curiosity and the aim of understanding network security and threat detection more deeply, I decided to work on a personal project to deploy and analyze a honeypot environment using the T-Pot platform on a Debian 12 cloud instance. The objective was to capture, analyze, and understand attack patterns to enhance my cybersecurity skills!

### Project Setup and Deployment:

Upon establishing what I wanted to do, I faced the inevitable barrage of initial challenges that come with starting any ambitious/technical project. Questions swirled around like a hive of curious bees: Where will I host this honeypot? How will I create it? And let's be honest... what exactly is a honeypot?

#### VULTR Cloud Service

With all of that in mind, I decided that the best first step was to determine where to host the project, as using my own computer didn't seem like the most... practical option. After some research, I discovered Vultr, a promising and cost-efficient cloud service provider. Upon signing up, I was pleasantly surprised to receive $100 in free credits, allowing me to run my machine and experiment freely for the next two months without any cost!

When deploying and configuring my new machine, I was presented with a variety of operating system options. After CAREFUL consideration (I chose a random one), I chose to use the Debian 12 operating system.
